		<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<h3>Social playful interface to encourage positive behaviour in THUAS</h3>
		<img class="wearableIMG" src="images/pi.png">
		<p>Tables in THUAS are often left littered and unwelcoming for other students. In this situation having playful interface would encourage positive behavior of the students.</p>
		<p>As the main interaction, giant digital tree would be placed on one of the walls, that would showcase the progress. On the floors, seating areas and tables pressure sensors would be installed. They would measure if someone is walking, sitting or placing his hands or things on tables. Also, projectors in the ceilings would be installed for animations. The concept would work as follows: person, who have just finished eating has his leftovers and trash on the table. He starts to stand up and walk away. In the meantime, nasty creatures appear from underneath of trash (projected on the table according to pressure spots). They start crawling to the person showing at the trash. Person picks up his trash, creatures turn into clouds. Person dumps the trash and clouds fly to the tree through floor and waters it. If person wouldn’t throw away his trash, creatures would follow person by also influencing the state of the tree – creatures would start to chew the tree down.</p>
		<p>Other people can help to keep the state of the tree in perfect condition by throwing away the trash and keeping environment clean.</p>
		<p>This concept is purely single-player but acquiring help from other people can be possible. It is designed to be a cooperative in order to keep the environment clean. It falls under parallel exertion category and knowing sub-category, meaning that players are aware of each other’s actions, since a tree reflects that.	</p>
