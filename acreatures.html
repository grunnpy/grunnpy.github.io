		<h3 class="sectionInner">Easy Order automatic ordering machine at McDonalds is an Artificial Creature</h3>
		<img class="wearableIMG" src="images/mc.jpg">

		<p>McDonalds automatic ordering machine has the needs of being touched, payed and have sufficient quantity of paper for printing receipt. These can be fulfilled, when a person comes up to the machine and chooses an order by touching it. Then the first need of being touched is satisfied. Then the person has to pay for his order by putting his card in the right place. This makes the need for being payed fulfilled. And lastly, machine has to print out a receipt on which the number is displayed, so the buyer knows when to collect his food. This need needs to be done by McDonald’s employee – he needs to make sure that there is enough paper present.</p>
		<p>When machine is not being touched, he feels lonely and so it has a slideshow of pictures with food, that stimulates the person to come up to it, touch and explore. Although, when the machine is only used for browsing and not being payed it has no closure – machine feels angry and betrayed. It keeps on reminding person if he wants to continue with his order. But none of this matters, if everything is completed and suddenly machine notices that it has ran out of paper. It is surprised at first and then the mood changes to desperation – machine can’t finish.</p>
		<p>Automatic ordering machine is a creature, because it reacts to human behaviour – if the machine sees that human is doubting himself, machine gives suggestions and asks if he still wants to continue.</p>
		<p>Machine also stimulates person into one or the other option, in example buying medium size deal or large size. These actions indicate, that machine cares for the human and interacts with him, which makes it a creature.</p>
