		<p>To be honest, I didn’t choose the most technologically advanced things. With that in mind, I spotted this expanding ball and projection of a human in space. Ball’s purpose was quite simple – structure is made in a way that when it’s dropped, it expands and when pulled back it shrinks back to a smaller ball. I found it interesting, because of the structure and it gave the impression that the ball was alive and breathing because transitions from small to big and from big to small were very smooth. The space traveller installation was a projection on a big wall, which told a story about space and showed human going through it. What caught my eye was that human form/texture was changing depending on the shown background, which I found fascinating and pleasant to watch. As mentioned above, since these installations aren’t very technologically advanced, they are very easily explained. Despite that, I still chose them, because I feel like they could be a good inspiration for our final project. For example, in the artificial creatures topic it would be interesting to make design with such structure as the ball has, that it could easily transform and move or imitate another action with such structure. In addition, by using project mapping as it was done for the projection of traveller, creature could change it’s texture according to different factors, such as mood, human input or simple algorithm. These are just few ideas that popped into my head and I that’s why I chose these installations.</p>

		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>Excursion was quite fun despite the fact that a lot of the installations were purely for younger age group (it was either too low or too small for me to experience certain installations). I liked the diversity of them and how many topics museum covered – human, environment, space, physics, chemistry. I was impressed by the size of the museum and how nicely educational it was – installations taught about interesting and important scientific things, by combining it with playful interactions and visualisations. It was valuable to see in what ways such complex things can be explained and shown in a fun and engaging way.</p>
