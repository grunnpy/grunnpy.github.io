		<h3 class="sectionInner">Smart Tattoo concept for interaction between people that are miles apart</h3>
		<img class="wearableIMG" src="images/wearable1.png">
		<p>Communication and interactions with people who are far away are harder and limited. This wearable in the form of smart tattoo is just a right solution for these situations.</p>
		<p>Smart tattoos are placed on wanted places, whether that be a cheek, shoulder, hand, thigh or other part of the body of the person, who wants to take use of this wearable. Then tattoos are registered and set on the special app, where the list of tattoos is present. This follows by connecting tattoos to the person, who would send stimulations to the receiver. Person, who wants to send interaction, uses an app on his phone if he doesn’t have such wearables himself. This can be done via app by touching desired tattoos on visualization and setting desired pressure. If another person has tattoos as well, he simply touches desired place on his body, which transmits the feeling to the registered receiver at the same place. If sender does not have a tattoo on the same place as receiver, he sends interactions through an app. In this way, people can communicate without words even if they are far away without losing sense of touch whenever they want.</p>
		<p>These smart tattoos are made of super thin self-adhesive material, that can be stuck on the skin and removed repeatedly. They are available in all colors, it can be translucent or neon bright - depending on what user wants. Size depends on the place, where tattoo would be placed. There are bent pieces, for cheeks and shoulders, also different sized strips for hands, sides and thighs. Every tattoo is flexible in order not to interfere with one’s movements.</p>

		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>Main trending wearable at this point is a smart watch – it’s all the craze regarding wearables. Apple is releasing new Apple Watch edition, Samsung Galaxy Watch Active, Fitbit Versa and many more. In this category also falls headphones, that are upgrading constantly, with controversial Airpods on the market. Although, sometimes something new also can be spotted – like wristband, that tracks your emotions, developed by Amazon and which raised a lot of questions, regarding why we need it and privacy issues. Also, it is said, that Google Glasses is being revived, although doesn’t seem to be too different from its predecessor. While more “extreme” and unfamiliar wearables such as smart tattoos (main developers being MIT, Microsoft and Harvard), smart rings and smart clothes are still on the rise.</p>
