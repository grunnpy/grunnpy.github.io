		<h2>Week 1</h2>

		<h3>Multiple blinking LED’s</h3>
		<h4>Assignment 3C</h4>
		<p>For this assignment I had to make a circuit with two LED lights and write a code where one light would blink twice as fast as the other one. I took the exemplary built-in code for one blinking LED and adapted it so it works according to the assignment by adding the second LED.</p>
		<p>This exercise was challenging, because I had not only to understand the timeline of the blinking lights, but also how the code works – what different built-in functions like pinMode() do. In the end I succeeded after writing down the order of LED states, e. g. when the green light should be on and when off. I had to understand, that the green light should be turned off and on twice while red light stays on. This was tricky, since I had troubles with perceiving what effect the delay has and how it works.</p>
		
		<h3>Fading in and out LED’s</h3>
		<h4>Assignment 4C</h4>
		<p>In this assignment instead of turning LEDs simply on and off, challenge was to achieve fading effect with lights. For this I used a built-in function analogWrite() that sets the brightness of selected LED between the range of 0 and 255, where 0 is completely off and 255 completely on. Also some adjustments to the board needed to be made – not all pins are suitable pulse width modulation, in other words – pin pulses between HIGH and LOW at very high frequency. I chose pins 10 and 11 on my board. After completing A and B parts of exercise, I had to make one LED slowly fade in while other fades outs at the same time. I achieved this by adding second analogWrite() function for another LED and reusing value set in the loop (in my case it was integer x) so brightness is reversed.</p>

		<h3>Fading LED’s controlled with potmeter</h3>
		<h4>Assignment 6C</h4>
		<p>For this assignment I had to add a potmeter – rotary knob, that gives an analog input. I changed the circuit according to the given picture example in workbook – connected potmeter and additional jumper wires in relevant places. In the code I used analogRead() function to read the value of potmeter. It could be printed in serial monitor, where whenever knob was turned the changed value would appear. In order to translate this value to the one I could use for brightness of LEDs I used map() function, which changes value in existing range to the desired one. In my case, potmeter returned the value between 0 and 1023 and brightness is defined between 0 and 255. Making one LED fade in while other fades out was relatively easy, because this exact effect was used before in assignment 4C.</p>

		<h3>Controlling LED’s with light</h3>
		<h4>Assignment 7</h4>
		<p>In this assignment I connected one LDR light sensitive resistor together with 10kΩ resistor to my circuit that has 2 LED lights. This circuit is used to dim those two LED lights depending on light state in the room. When the code is uploaded, I opened serial monitor that showed me the value of amount of light that has been captured with LDR. Whenever I would put my hand above the LDR blocking some light, the number would drop from around 908 to 500. After distinguishing these two values, I used a map() function as previously in assignment 6C, that converts wanted value from one specified range to another range. Since the lights were flickering whenever I would cover LDR with my hand, I used constrain() function as well, which puts boundaries and doesn’t let the value reach beyond them. This made LEDs to turn of completely when LDR was covered with hand.</p>

		<h3>Voltage divider</h3>
		<h4>Assignment 8</h4>
		<p>For this assignment I removed 10kΩ resistor and replaced it with another LDR light sensitive resistor. This circuit was still connected to two LEDs. This circuit is creating output voltage depending on light received by two LDR resistors. If both LDRs receive same amount of light, circuit turns output voltage half as input voltage – 2.5. Although, if one LDR resistor is in darker setting than the other, output voltage changes depending on the amount of light and which LDR receives it. For example, if first resistor is in darker setting than second one, then output voltage will be smaller than half of input voltage. On the other hand, if first LDR is in lighter setting than the other one, output voltage is higher than half of input voltage. This is based on my calculations that I did with given formula and testing video, where lights, connected to this circuit and both dependant on LDR value, respond differently only when one of the LDRs is receiving less light. Different values could also be seen in serial monitor.</p>
