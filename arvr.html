		<h1>AR & VR</h1>
		<p id="headlineText">This is the fourth topic.</p>

		<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<p>For this assignment we had to choose three areas where AR and/or VR could be implemented and describe the concepts we come up with. I choose the following areas:</p>
		
		<h3 class="sectionInner">Workshops of famous artists in VR</h3>
		<h5>Area: Art and / or museums</h5>
		<img class="arIMG" src="images/museum.jpg">

		<p>With the help of VR, museums could recreate the workshop of famous artists. Visitors of these exhibitions could visually experience, how the environment in which Van Gogh or Dali created looked like and help them to get a better sense of what kind of people they were. These exhibitions would have a room with a desired layout, that would reflect in virtual reality. Users could touch and feel bigger surfaces, like walls, tables. Every other detail would be created in VR environment, users also could interact with it, by pointing to an object and getting information related to it.</p>
		

		<h3 class="sectionInner">Geography in AR</h3>
		<h5>Area: Education and / or research</h5>
		<img class="arIMG" src="images/geo.jpg">

		<p>AR could widely be used in school during lessons, especially for geography subject. During these classes, pupils learn about the earth - different places, it’s specifications and statistics, but often it is hard for schoolers to imagine unseen things and understand them only from 2D pictures. Thus AR could be used as a tool for children to get familiar with their planet. Learning device with the AR possibilities would be pointed to pictures in books and kids immediately could see a 3D representation in their device. It could also be used to showcase different places all around the world.</p>

		
		<h3 class="sectionInner">Infrastructure in VR</h3>
		<h5>Area: Cars, car technology, road construction and / or infrastructure</h5>
		<img class="arIMG" src="images/infra.jpg">

		<p>As the world is progressing and infrastructure of the cities is constantly being updated, the usage of VR could help test plans without having to spend a lot of money. It’s important, that every new creation, whether that be a park, residential building or a statue fits within existing infrastructure not only by aesthetics, but also by usability. VR could imitate existing people traffic in the area and help in deciding core elements of the design. Design could also be placed in VR environment and tested with users, before building it.</p>
