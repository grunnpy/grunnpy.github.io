		<h2>Assignments</h2>

		<h3>Assignment 1 - ellipses</h3>
		<p>I wrote a program that draws three ellipses at various locations, with various colors in various widths and heights and with and without borders of various colors.</p>

		<h3>Assignment 2 - shapes</h3>
		<p>I wrote a program that draws at least four different shapes that aren't circles in various colors and are at various locations.</p>

		<h3>Assignment CV1 - LiveCam ellipse</h3>
		<p>I adjust the code, that recognises faces so that a circle is drawn instead of a rectangle.</p>

		<h3>Assignment CV2 - LiveCam anonymous bar</h3>
		<p>I adjusted the examplary code so that every recognised face gets an 'anonymous' black bar in front of his eyes.</p>

		<h3>Assignment CV3 - LiveCam something cool happens</h3>
		<p>I adjusted the code of one of the example, OpenCVBrightestPointDetectionLiveCam to be exact, so that the Bare Bears are displayed on the brightest point. </p>
