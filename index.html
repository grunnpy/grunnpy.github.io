		<p id="headlineText" >This is Human - Computer Interaction course portfolio in 2nd year of User Experience bachelor at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Hello, I am Viktorija Liberytė, second year student of UXD programme in THUAS university. I am quiet, but ambitious student, that enjoys drawing in free time. I love frozen raspberries as well as fresh strawberries and this website is a portfolio illustrating my learning process during Human Computer Interaction course.</p>
		
		<h2>Expectations of the course</h2>
		<p>I expect a lot from this course. I expect to learn to work with different mediums and express my ideas via something other than paper and Adobe XD. I expect fruitful lectures, that would inspire me and help to come up with ideas for final project, that will be developed during lab weeks. And lastly, I expect to be paired with ambitious and hard-working students for the final project, so we could achieve something spectacular.</p>

		<h2>What I want to learn?</h2>
		<p>I want to learn all cool stuff in this course. As mentioned in expectations, I would like to learn to work with different mediums, revive my coding skills and develop such final design, that I could put into my portfolio with which I would search for companies for my graduation project. Additionally, I believe that two last weeks of this course will be quite intense, so I would like to learn to work better in unknown environment among other people, which after programming bootcamp last year proved to be challenging for me.</p>
