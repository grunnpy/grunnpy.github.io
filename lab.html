			<p class="labText">Today was the first day on this project. I met with my team and after quick briefing in the morning, we started of with our SCRUMish board and dived into the project. We started off by making a mindmap of what creature could be like and what are the features that should be apparent. Then we brainstormed over one of the topics we had – what should be creature’s purpose and goal. After listing possibilities, we used dot-voting technique which got us to designing a creature that is motivator and entertainer. I contributed by pushing my teammates to move forward and also by taking part in concepting. We started testing with building Voice Kit, and testing out Google Assistant, but soon enough we understood, that it’s a dead end – we aren’t able to do custom answers with it without paying and limitations were too big. So we moved on to working with Arduino and came up with idea to display text on a screen instead of telling it out loud. Stefano and Art connected everything on the board and I uploaded the code. We explored the possibilities with different exemplary codes and changed it up a bit to our preferences, e. g. the code that makes text move from one side to another, I made it move only from one side and with easily customizable text kept as an array and not dependant on the length. We will work on this more tomorrow.</p>

			<p>This day was quite slower than yesterday. We started off with short briefing and then morning standup within the group. It wasn’t very fruitful and interesting session so soon enough we found ourselves working towards individual things. Me and Stefano started making an Arduino circuit which contained LCD screen (from yesterday) and I was doing most of the coding to make text appear in a screen in randomized way from pre-written sentences kept in an array. When we achieved that, we connected a button to the circuit, which would change the text with every press. This took a while, we first got stuck with non-working button, which we later on uncovered that was caused by poorly connected circuit. After that I got stuck with the code – in the beginning it was not displaying text correctly, then it didn’t react to the push of a button. After consultation with Tim and tweaking the code we finally made it work. In the end I also managed to connect a second button that would display non-motivational text the same way that the other one was displayed. We finished the day by short briefing by Chris.</p>

			<p>Today was a good day. We started the morning with daily standup, followed by quest lecture, during which we got to know more about artificial creatures and intelligence. It was quite a long lecture, and the main takeaway for me was that artificial creature needs to be simple and executed perfectly, since in the beginning of the day we had a lot of ideas for the final concept so we knew we had to minimize and simplify a lot. I sketched out concepts for our final design today, while Art was making eyes with LED screens and eyebrows with servomotors. Karen finally figured out how to do touch sensitive circuit. After lunch I went to the city center to find styrofoam sphere that we would use in our final design. When I came back, we brainstormed quite a bit and came up with a plan to make sort of a caveman with touch sensitive beard hiding in a cave. We still need to develop this concept a bit more further, but at this point I think we are right on track. We planned tasks for tomorrow, like code potmeter that would define emotional state of the caveman, connect and try out a speaker, and also plan what could be the output from other inputs, like beard.</p>

			<p>Thursday began with a morning standup during which we talked about what we achieved yesterday and what we wanted to do today. Plan for today was to first come up with a promise for final project, that we later wrote down on a piece of paper and taped to the wall and also discuss and decide about the scenario/behaviour we want our creature to have. After the morning standup, we listened to the guest lecture, which I found very fascinating. We got to see “Buqs” – artificial creatures, that are shaped in abstract forms and have sound and light as actuators. They were placed in random city locations and creators were interested in the interaction between creatures and people. This fruitful presentation gave me more insights on artificial creatures, especially that combination of visuals and sounds is more impactful and that creature doesn’t need to be shaped like an animal to look alive. After that, we had a discussion about our creature’s behaviour that took quite a while, but I feel it was necessary for us to move forward. In my eyes it’s important to have a clear direction at this point, and structure, that I sketched out I think will be handy during the following days. Later on, Art tested how the speaker works pluged into the Arduino board, I assisted with that and sketched for the final concept in free time. After that, we tried out two LED matrixes as eyes, which appeared to be quite more complex than anticipated. I helped out with it when needed and were second pair of eyes. At this point, I enjoy working with Art since I believe he is a very talented coder/engineer and it’s always fascinating to learn something new. When I was free, I prototyped on the beard and sketched out the cave, creature and it’s environment.</p>

			<p>Friday passed quite quickly. In the morning we did the standup within the group for 12 minutes, everyone talked of what they did yesterday, plans for today and if they encountered any problems. After that we had a guest lecture, which I found interesting and fun. Marcello talked about playful interfaces and even though my project is related to artificial creatures, I got some insights from it. He talked that people most of the time try to break things/ not go through the most common route, which made me think about our project and what boundaries do we have. I also liked the thought, that design needs to be finished in order to work and after it’s finished certain things can be altered to make it more playful. And lastly, I respected that he learnt from other’s mistakes and adapted his presentation to the environment – increased the contrast and brought a pointer, it was one of the ideas he wanted to convey with his presentation as well. After the lecture, we made requirements in our group for the final project and prioritised the tasks using MoSCoW method. Then we divided tasks between us and started working. At first I sketched and planned the looks of final design more in detail also measured everything and later in the day I once again was a second pair of eyes for Art and helped out with the structure of the code. I also participated a bit in designing the looks of the eyes and made very low-fi prototype/mock-up of the caveman.</p>
