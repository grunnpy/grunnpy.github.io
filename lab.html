			<p class="labText">Today was the first day on this project. I met with my team and after quick briefing in the morning, we started of with our SCRUMish board and dived into the project. We started off by making a mindmap of what creature could be like and what are the features that should be apparent. Then we brainstormed over one of the topics we had – what should be creature’s purpose and goal. After listing possibilities, we used dot-voting technique which got us to designing a creature that is motivator and entertainer. I contributed by pushing my teammates to move forward and also by taking part in concepting. We started testing with building Voice Kit, and testing out Google Assistant, but soon enough we understood, that it’s a dead end – we aren’t able to do custom answers with it without paying and limitations were too big. So we moved on to working with Arduino and came up with idea to display text on a screen instead of telling it out loud. Stefano and Art connected everything on the board and I uploaded the code. We explored the possibilities with different exemplary codes and changed it up a bit to our preferences, e. g. the code that makes text move from one side to another, I made it move only from one side and with easily customizable text kept as an array and not dependant on the length. We will work on this more tomorrow.</p>

			<p>This day was quite slower than yesterday. We started off with short briefing and then morning standup within the group. It wasn’t very fruitful and interesting session so soon enough we found ourselves working towards individual things. Me and Stefano started making an Arduino circuit which contained LCD screen (from yesterday) and I was doing most of the coding to make text appear in a screen in randomized way from pre-written sentences kept in an array. When we achieved that, we connected a button to the circuit, which would change the text with every press. This took a while, we first got stuck with non-working button, which we later on uncovered that was caused by poorly connected circuit. After that I got stuck with the code – in the beginning it was not displaying text correctly, then it didn’t react to the push of a button. After consultation with Tim and tweaking the code we finally made it work. In the end I also managed to connect a second button that would display non-motivational text the same way that the other one was displayed. We finished the day by short briefing by Chris.</p>

			<p>Today was a good day. We started the morning with daily standup, followed by quest lecture, during which we got to know more about artificial creatures and intelligence. It was quite a long lecture, and the main takeaway for me was that artificial creature needs to be simple and executed perfectly, since in the beginning of the day we had a lot of ideas for the final concept so we knew we had to minimize and simplify a lot. I sketched out concepts for our final design today, while Art was making eyes with LED screens and eyebrows with servomotors. Karen finally figured out how to do touch sensitive circuit. After lunch I went to the city center to find styrofoam sphere that we would use in our final design. When I came back, we brainstormed quite a bit and came up with a plan to make sort of a caveman with touch sensitive beard hiding in a cave. We still need to develop this concept a bit more further, but at this point I think we are right on track. We planned tasks for tomorrow, like code potmeter that would define emotional state of the caveman, connect and try out a speaker, and also plan what could be the output from other inputs, like beard.</p>
