			<p class="labText">Today was the first day on this project. I met with my team and after quick briefing in the morning, we started of with our SCRUMish board and dived into the project. We started off by making a mindmap of what creature could be like and what are the features that should be apparent. Then we brainstormed over one of the topics we had – what should be creature’s purpose and goal. After listing possibilities, we used dot-voting technique which got us to designing a creature that is motivator and entertainer. I contributed by pushing my teammates to move forward and also by taking part in concepting. We started testing with building Voice Kit, and testing out Google Assistant, but soon enough we understood, that it’s a dead end – we aren’t able to do custom answers with it without paying and limitations were too big. So we moved on to working with Arduino and came up with idea to display text on a screen instead of telling it out loud. Stefano and Art connected everything on the board and I uploaded the code. We explored the possibilities with different exemplary codes and changed it up a bit to our preferences, e. g. the code that makes text move from one side to another, I made it move only from one side and with easily customizable text kept as an array and not dependant on the length. We will work on this more tomorrow.</p>

			<p>This day was quite slower than yesterday. We started off with short briefing and then morning standup within the group. It wasn’t very fruitful and interesting session so soon enough we found ourselves working towards individual things. Me and Stefano started making an Arduino circuit which contained LCD screen (from yesterday) and I was doing most of the coding to make text appear in a screen in randomized way from pre-written sentences kept in an array. When we achieved that, we connected a button to the circuit, which would change the text with every press. This took a while, we first got stuck with non-working button, which we later on uncovered that was caused by poorly connected circuit. After that I got stuck with the code – in the beginning it was not displaying text correctly, then it didn’t react to the push of a button. After consultation with Tim and tweaking the code we finally made it work. In the end I also managed to connect a second button that would display non-motivational text the same way that the other one was displayed. We finished the day by short briefing by Chris.</p>

			<p>Today was a good day. We started the morning with daily standup, followed by quest lecture, during which we got to know more about artificial creatures and intelligence. It was quite a long lecture, and the main takeaway for me was that artificial creature needs to be simple and executed perfectly, since in the beginning of the day we had a lot of ideas for the final concept so we knew we had to minimize and simplify a lot. I sketched out concepts for our final design today, while Art was making eyes with LED screens and eyebrows with servomotors. Karen finally figured out how to do touch sensitive circuit. After lunch I went to the city center to find styrofoam sphere that we would use in our final design. When I came back, we brainstormed quite a bit and came up with a plan to make sort of a caveman with touch sensitive beard hiding in a cave. We still need to develop this concept a bit more further, but at this point I think we are right on track. We planned tasks for tomorrow, like code potmeter that would define emotional state of the caveman, connect and try out a speaker, and also plan what could be the output from other inputs, like beard.</p>

			<p>Thursday began with a morning standup during which we talked about what we achieved yesterday and what we wanted to do today. Plan for today was to first come up with a promise for final project, that we later wrote down on a piece of paper and taped to the wall and also discuss and decide about the scenario/behaviour we want our creature to have. After the morning standup, we listened to the guest lecture, which I found very fascinating. We got to see “Buqs” – artificial creatures, that are shaped in abstract forms and have sound and light as actuators. They were placed in random city locations and creators were interested in the interaction between creatures and people. This fruitful presentation gave me more insights on artificial creatures, especially that combination of visuals and sounds is more impactful and that creature doesn’t need to be shaped like an animal to look alive. After that, we had a discussion about our creature’s behaviour that took quite a while, but I feel it was necessary for us to move forward. In my eyes it’s important to have a clear direction at this point, and structure, that I sketched out I think will be handy during the following days. Later on, Art tested how the speaker works pluged into the Arduino board, I assisted with that and sketched for the final concept in free time. After that, we tried out two LED matrixes as eyes, which appeared to be quite more complex than anticipated. I helped out with it when needed and were second pair of eyes. At this point, I enjoy working with Art since I believe he is a very talented coder/engineer and it’s always fascinating to learn something new. When I was free, I prototyped on the beard and sketched out the cave, creature and it’s environment.</p>

			<p>Friday passed quite quickly. In the morning we did the standup within the group for 12 minutes, everyone talked of what they did yesterday, plans for today and if they encountered any problems. After that we had a guest lecture, which I found interesting and fun. Marcello talked about playful interfaces and even though my project is related to artificial creatures, I got some insights from it. He talked that people most of the time try to break things/ not go through the most common route, which made me think about our project and what boundaries do we have. I also liked the thought, that design needs to be finished in order to work and after it’s finished certain things can be altered to make it more playful. And lastly, I respected that he learnt from other’s mistakes and adapted his presentation to the environment – increased the contrast and brought a pointer, it was one of the ideas he wanted to convey with his presentation as well. After the lecture, we made requirements in our group for the final project and prioritised the tasks using MoSCoW method. Then we divided tasks between us and started working. At first I sketched and planned the looks of final design more in detail also measured everything and later in the day I once again was a second pair of eyes for Art and helped out with the structure of the code. I also participated a bit in designing the looks of the eyes and made very low-fi prototype/mock-up of the caveman.</p>

			<p>Today we started with daily standup and talked about what we did on Friday and how we should continue. For today, we decided to finish connecting the final circuit for the project, by attaching the beard and fixing ultrasonic sensors. Art also finished sounds for the creature and optimized eyebrows. In the morning I went shopping for PUR foam, paint, cardboard and glue sticks. After I came back, I started working on template for the cave – I cut cardboard to the measures I had made on Friday and made a box that would be an entry to the cave that we could cover with PUR. PUR happened to be quite a disappointment in the beginning, because we used up 750 ml very quickly and it wasn’t even a third of the cave’s size we wanted. We thought of different ways of how to make it work without breaking the budget too much and thought of putting crumpled paper and covering it with paint and PUR. During the last few hours I made the final beard and eyebrows. We know we have a lot of work, but tomorrow we’ll see how much PUR has actually risen and get working from there. The code also needs some tweaking and the creature needs to be done, but we know we can make it in time.</p>

			<p>Wednesday was busy and productive day. In the morning we started with talking about our plans for today – Art and Karen did the coding and Charlotte, Stefano and me continued building the cave. It was an interesting challenge and we had to pivot quite a bit. At first we thought we were going to make it only with spraying PUR on the template – it didn’t work, because it wasn’t too much of that material in the bottle, and we didn’t want to break our budget of buying several cans of it. Also time played its part in it as well – 24 hours need to pass in order for foam to dry completely and since we wanted the cave to be quite big, 70cm high, 1 meter wide, we would have needed to make it in layers which would have taken too much time. Then we decided to put crumbled newspaper and craft paper as a base and put layer of PUR on top. However Chris came up to us and advised to use chicken wire for better stability. And then when we discussed with a group about it, Karen came up with the idea to use craft paper to cover the structure underneath, which looked very close to what I imagined the cave should look like. So we continued with this idea and stuck paper and cardboard at random places in order to make it more voluminous and form a unique shape. For tomorrow we still need to finish sticking newspaper and covering it, but for now we already have inside of the cave covered in aluminium foil that I offered to crumble to have more depth and also I painted the ground black for aesthetical purposes. </p>

			<p>Thursday was the day when we had to finish our product. It started with us moving to the new place where we would present in the expo. We tested the code and moved more towards physical design. I took part in making the cave – sticking newspapers and cardboard for understructure and later on covering it with craft paper. Since the cave is quite big, it took a bit of time for us to finish it. Then we started making the creature itself – in the morning I painted the fur from plush animal we bought before – we took out the insides and from neon green frog it turned to dark green caveman. While it dried, I sculped the foam board that would be placed inside the fur and would carry two servomotors, two LED matrixes and beard wire. I made places for them with exacto knife, fitted them, we taped the wires and covered it with the animal’s fur. Then I made holes for the eyebrows and a beard wire, and when we wanted to cut out the eyes, we plugged the creature into the power and noticed that material gives a pretty good affect for the eyes. So we just cut a bit of hair where the eyes where just for them to show a bit better and creature was nearly done. For the final touch we attached the beard. And although we had some connection problems during the process and one of the LED matrixes stopped working, we found solutions to all of these troubles and continued. Driving platform was next – I made the box that would hide it, we covered it with the craft paper and made it look a bit like stone. And when the day was nearly gone, we encountered some power issues – battery we had didn’t suffice. We decided to leave this issue for tomorrow.</p>

			<p>Expo day started with short briefing by Chris and soon enough we moved on to work on our projects. We solved power issue by using one battery for the driving platform and powerbank for the creature’s features. For that we went to Gamma in the morning to get new batteries. When we came back and tested the creature, we noticed it wasn’t driving straight – Art came up with the idea to build guide tracks for it. We borrowed wood piece from fellow students, Art cut it in half and I glued the one that broke back together. We put it in the cave, but then we noticed that the uneven ground that we had from layers of cardboard, caused some driving troubles for the creature. So we borrowed another piece of wood from fellow students and used it as a solid even ground and glued the guides on it. This made a good path for the creature to drive on and on this note, we announced finished with the project and happy with the outcome, since while me and Art were working on the ground, others covered the table with the craft paper to make it look nicer.</p>
